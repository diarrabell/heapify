Lab 6

In this lab we implemented functions that perform heap sort and radix sort.
Heap.java, HeapTest.java, and RadixSort.java function as according to lab instructions.

radix.java is Radix Sort implementation provided by professor.
StdOut.java, Std.Random.java, and Stopwatch.java are provided by the professor.

Radix Sort test cases:

Case 1: [222, 223, 221, 228]
new implementation: 0.0s
old implementation: 0.0s

Case 2: [559, 332, 900, 200]
new implementation: 0.0s
old implementation: 1.0

Case 3: [1000, 2500, 8000, 600]
new implementation: 1.0s
old implementation: 0.0s

Case 4: [250, 700, 298, 467, 389, 798, 198, 298, 478, 299]
new implementation: 1.0s
old implementation: 0.0s

Case 5: randomly generated array
new implementation: 8.0s
old implementation: 8.0s
